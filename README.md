## 🧠 Learning Goals

By the end of this project, you will have:
- Built and deployed a multimodal LLM + CV system
- Used Azure App Services, Azure OpenAI, and (optionally) Azure Monitor
- Learned to build web apps with Streamlit
- Created a production-ready, portfolio-level GitHub repo

---

## 🏁 Stretch Goals (Post-v1)

- Add PDF/file ingestion (e.g., business proposals, brochures)
- Add user feedback loop (correct wrong predictions)
- Add industry/underwriter dashboard
- Integrate structured data sources (e.g., BBB, Yelp)
