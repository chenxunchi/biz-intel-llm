## üîß Advanced Features

### **Intelligent Risk Aggregation**

The system applies domain-specific rules for optimal accuracy:

- **Vehicle Use Risk**: `MAX(text_assessment, visual_assessment)`
  - Visual evidence (trucks, equipment) often overrides text descriptions
  - High confidence when both sources align

- **E-commerce Risk**: `PRIMARY(text_assessment) + MINOR(visual_confirmation)`  
  - Text analysis detects online sales functionality
  - Visual analysis provides minimal e-commerce insights

- **Cyber Risk**: `TEXT_ONLY(business_model_analysis)`
  - Business model and digital infrastructure assessment
  - Visual analysis provides negligible cyber risk insight

### **NAICS Confidence Scoring Algorithm**

Multi-factor confidence assessment:
- **Website Quality** (0-40%): Professional site structure and content quality
- **Business Specificity** (0-40%): "HVAC repair services" vs "general contractor"  
- **Industry Keywords** (0-20%): Alignment with standard industry terminology

### **Visual Intelligence Features**

- **Equipment Detection**: Construction machinery, vehicles, specialized tools
- **Facility Assessment**: Warehouse scale, retail space, office environment
- **Operational Scale**: Fleet size, equipment quantity, facility scope
- **Business Context Mapping**: Equipment type ‚Üí business capability enhancement
