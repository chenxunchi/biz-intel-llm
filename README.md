## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenxunchi/biz-intel-llm.git
cd biz-intel-llm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Configuration**
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
```bash
# Required: LLM API
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# OR
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/

# Required: Computer Vision
AZURE_CV_KEY=your_azure_cv_key
AZURE_CV_ENDPOINT=https://your-cv-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/

# Optional: Analysis tuning
MAX_IMAGES_FOR_ANALYSIS=5
MIN_IMAGE_SIZE=100
```

### **3. Usage**
```python
from core.pipeline import BusinessIntelligencePipeline

# Initialize the complete system
pipeline = BusinessIntelligencePipeline()

# Analyze any business website
result = pipeline.analyze_business_website("https://example-landscaping.com")

# Access comprehensive results
print(f"Business: {result.enhanced_business_summary}")
print(f"NAICS: {result.naics_code} (confidence: {result.naics_confidence:.1%})")
print(f"Vehicle Risk: {result.final_risk_indicators['vehicle_use']['level']}")
print(f"Capabilities: {result.business_capabilities}")
```

## 📈 Example Output

```json
{
  "enhanced_business_summary": "Professional landscaping company with commercial fleet operations and heavy equipment capabilities for large-scale projects",
  "naics_code": "561730",
  "naics_confidence": 0.87,

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### **Intelligent Risk Aggregation**
- **Vehicle Use**: MAX(text_level, visual_level) - visual evidence often overrides
- **E-commerce**: Primarily text_level - visual rarely provides e-commerce evidence
- **Cyber Risk**: Text_level only - visual provides minimal insight

### **NAICS Confidence Scoring**
- Website Quality Factor (0-0.4): Higher quality sites = more reliable classifications
- Business Description Specificity (0-0.4): "Commercial HVAC repair" vs "general services"
- Industry Keyword Matching (0-0.2): Alignment with NAICS category keywords

### **Visual Business Intelligence**
- Equipment detection with business context mapping
- Facility type and scale assessment
- Business capability enhancements from visual evidence
- Domain-specific image filtering and prioritization

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### **Azure App Service**
```bash
# Configure Azure CLI
az login
az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name myBusinessIntelApp

# Deploy
az webapp up --name myBusinessIntelApp
```

### **Environment Variables (Production)**
Set in Azure App Service → Configuration:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or Azure OpenAI credentials
- `AZURE_CV_KEY` and `AZURE_CV_ENDPOINT`
- `MAX_IMAGES_FOR_ANALYSIS=5`
- `MIN_IMAGE_SIZE=100`

---

## 📊 Performance & Limitations

### **Performance Characteristics**
- **Analysis Time**: 30-90 seconds per website (depending on content volume)
- **Image Processing**: Up to 5 business-relevant images per analysis
- **Text Processing**: Up to 15,000 characters per LLM call
- **Confidence Accuracy**: 85%+ for well-structured business websites

### **Current Limitations**
- Requires Azure Computer Vision service for visual analysis
- Text analysis limited by LLM context window
- Image analysis quality depends on image availability and clarity
- NAICS classification confidence varies with business description specificity
